## The Concept

The team was formed around the idea of helping visually impaired users by designing a handheld ultrasonic device that provides haptic feedback through vibrations that increase and decrease proportional to the distance of objects you are pointing to in the immediate environment.

## The Timeline

Keaton and Jonas had purchased some of the key components for the echo device before the event.

After the initial presentation, the team found a spot to sit down and start hacking.

#### ALRIGHT!!!!

![Go Go!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echohack2016/project/master/img/IMG_20160416_193821.jpg)

And we need to do some some formulas to work out haptic feedback vs distance response..

![Working out formulas!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echohack2016/project/master/img/IMG_20160416_161527.jpg)

Write some code in the [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) IDE...
